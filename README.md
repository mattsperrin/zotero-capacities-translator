# zotero-capacities-translator
A translator for pasting zotero references into capacities

This may be useful to academics who wish to use zotero references in Capacities. It allows for a reference from Zotero to easily be copied across to capacities in an appropriate format. Please note, it copies over bulleted text only and is not designed to integrate with Properties.

## Instructions for set-up
1. Download the translator file.
2. Find 'translators' folder within the zotero installation (may be in your User folder) and paste the translator there.
3. Open Zotero. Edit -> Settings -> Export.
4. Under Quick Copy, Item Format, select 'Capacities Export'.

## Instructions for use
1. With a reference highlighted in Zotero, press Ctrl+Shift+C
2. Paste (Ctrl + V) into Capacities
3. I then convert this to a Publication object, which can be done quickly with the sequence Ctrl + V -> Esc -> I -> select object type from dropdown.
